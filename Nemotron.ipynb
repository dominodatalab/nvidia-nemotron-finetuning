    "# Fine-Tuning Nemotron-3 8B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n",
    "Nemotron-3 is a robust, powerful family of Large Language Models that can provide compelling responses on a wide range of tasks. While the 8B parameter base model serves as a strong baseline for multiple downstream tasks, they can lack in domain-specific knowledge or proprietary or otherwise sensitive information. Fine-tuning is often used as a means to update a model for a specific task or tasks to better respond to domain-specific prompts. This notebook walks through preparing a dataset and using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the base Nemotron-3 8B model from Hugging Face against the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of LoRA is based on the paper, [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nZeVKeeFYf9) by Hu et al."

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season.

He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.
